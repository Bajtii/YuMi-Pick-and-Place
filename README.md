# ü§ñ YuMi Pick and Place ‚Äì RobotStudio Project

## üìå Project Description

This project focuses on simulating a **two-arm ABB YuMi robot** performing a pick and place operation with quality control. The station workflow is based on the following sequence:

1. **First phase:** The robot picks up a product with one arm.<img width="1288" height="720" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-25 133326" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/435d53e3-ac3a-40f4-bce9-50d70296049e" />

2. **Second phase:** The product is positioned for quality inspection, where the robot takes a photo using its second arm.
3. **Third phase:** The second arm picks up the product after inspection.
4. **Fourth phase:** The product is placed in the designated location.
5. **Fifth phase:** The robot picks up the next product and repeats the sequence.

The project was implemented in **ABB RobotStudio**, providing a fully simulated environment for programming and testing the YuMi robot‚Äôs dual-arm coordination and quality control process.
