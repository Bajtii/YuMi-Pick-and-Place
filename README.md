# ü§ñ YuMi Pick and Place ‚Äì RobotStudio Project

## üìå Project Description

This project focuses on simulating a **two-arm ABB YuMi robot** performing a pick and place operation with quality control. The station workflow is based on the following sequence:

1. **First phase:** The robot picks up a product with one arm.<img width="1288" height="720" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-25 133326" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/435d53e3-ac3a-40f4-bce9-50d70296049e" />

2. **Second phase:** The product is positioned for quality inspection, where the robot takes a photo using its second arm.<img width="1332" height="705" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-25 133931" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc045065-e4d0-4c5f-a4e9-3f9fd588030e" />

3. **Third phase:** The second arm picks up the product after inspection.<img width="1335" height="722" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-25 133412 (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7637e738-1524-4b57-9174-2156b706bee3" /><img width="1331" height="731" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-25 133612 (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f19a944c-2a7c-43b0-864b-62052d7e56cd" />


4. **Fourth phase:** The product is placed in the designated location.
5. **Fifth phase:** The robot picks up the next product and repeats the sequence.<img width="1332" height="705" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-25 133931 (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad02e3f9-af27-4ae7-90db-e9a11dd871cf" />



The project was implemented in **ABB RobotStudio**, providing a fully simulated environment for programming and testing the YuMi robot‚Äôs dual-arm coordination and quality control process.

An important part of the implementation is the **gripper control logic** ‚Äî the opening and closing (release and grasp) of the robot's grippers is precisely controlled. This logic uses **persistent boolean variables (PERS BOOL)** to wait for the completion of specific gripper signals on each arm, ensuring proper synchronization before transitioning to the next step in the sequence.
